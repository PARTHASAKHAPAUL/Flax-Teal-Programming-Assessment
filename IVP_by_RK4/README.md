# Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta Method (RK4) Implementation in Rust and Python

This project implements the Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta (RK4) numerical method to solve the ordinary differential equation (ODE) given by:

\[ y' = 1 - t^2 + y \]

with the initial condition \( y(0) = 0.5 \) over the interval from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 2 \), using 10 steps.
